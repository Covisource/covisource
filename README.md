## **Welcome to CoviSource!**

We strive to take a step forward in the combat of this disease, therefore, we came up with CoviSource, a community-based platform for citizens all over India to discover and share covid resources.

## **Inspiration**

The tweets from thousands of Indians on twitter, asking for oxygen, plasma, or remdesivir to save their loved ones were deeply saddening. We wanted to create a medium for users to find these resources, despite their location. Something that would be easy and intuitive, something that could be used by rich and poor alike. Something that would not have factors of luck involved, like making sure your tweet was seen by many. Thats why we came up with CoviSource, a platform for doctors,pharmacies, hospitals, men, women and any Indian to discover and share covid resources.
